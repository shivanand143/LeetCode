# Add Two Numbers (LeetCode Problem)

This repository contains the solution to the [LeetCode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/): **Add Two Numbers**.

## Problem Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example:

#### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`l1 = [2,4,3]`, `l2 = [5,6,4]`  
**Output:**  
`[7,0,8]`  
**Explanation:**  
342 + 465 = 807.

#### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`l1 = [0]`, `l2 = [0]`  
**Output:**  
`[0]`

#### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9]`, `l2 = [9,9,9,9]`  
**Output:**  
`[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]`

## Solution Explanation

The solution is implemented in Java. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

### Key Variables
1. **`dummy`**: A placeholder node for the resultant linked list. Its `next` pointer will eventually point to the head of the result list.
2. **`current`**: A pointer used to traverse and build the result list.
3. **`carry`**: Stores the carry-over value when adding two digits.

---

### Algorithm

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Create a `dummy` node.
   - Set `current` to point to `dummy`.
   - Initialize `carry` as 0.

2. **Iterate Through the Linked Lists**:
   - Traverse the linked lists (`l1` and `l2`) and process nodes until both are exhausted and no carry is left.

3. **Add Digits**:
   - Add the values of the current nodes from `l1` and `l2` (if present) along with the carry.
   - Calculate the carry for the next iteration as `carry = sum / 10`.
   - Extract the digit to store in the current result node as `sum % 10`.

4. **Create New Nodes**:
   - Add a new node to the result linked list with the computed digit.
   - Move the `current` pointer to this new node.

5. **Handle Carry**:
   - If there’s a remaining carry after processing both lists, add a new node with the carry value.

6. **Return the Result**:
   - Return `dummy.next`, which points to the head of the result linked list.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode current = dummy;
        int carry = 0;

        while (l1 != null || l2 != null || carry != 0) {
            int sum = carry;

            if (l1 != null) {
                sum += l1.val;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }

            if (l2 != null) {
                sum += l2.val;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }

            carry = sum / 10; // Calculate carry
            current.next = new ListNode(sum % 10); // Add digit to the result list
            current = current.next;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input:
`l1 = [2, 4, 3]` (represents 342),  
`l2 = [5, 6, 4]` (represents 465)

#### Iterations:

1. **Iteration 1**:
   - `l1.val = 2`, `l2.val = 5`, `carry = 0`
   - `sum = 2 + 5 + 0 = 7`
   - Add `7` to the result list.
   - Move `l1` and `l2` to the next nodes.

2. **Iteration 2**:
   - `l1.val = 4`, `l2.val = 6`, `carry = 0`
   - `sum = 4 + 6 + 0 = 10`
   - Add `0` to the result list (digit = `10 % 10`).
   - Update `carry = 1` (`10 / 10`).
   - Move `l1` and `l2` to the next nodes.

3. **Iteration 3**:
   - `l1.val = 3`, `l2.val = 4`, `carry = 1`
   - `sum = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8`
   - Add `8` to the result list.
   - No carry remains (`carry = 0`).
   - Move `l1` and `l2` to the next nodes (both are now `null`).

#### Output:
`[7, 0, 8]` (represents 807)

### Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:  
   `O(max(m, n))`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `l1` and `l2`.  
   - We traverse the longer list fully.

2. **Space Complexity**:  
   `O(max(m, n))` for the output linked list.
